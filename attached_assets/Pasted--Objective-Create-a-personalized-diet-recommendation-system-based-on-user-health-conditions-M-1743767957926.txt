🔹 Objective:
Create a personalized diet recommendation system based on user health conditions.
💡 MUST LOOK & FUNCTION LIKE AI, BUT WITHOUT USING API KEYS!

🛠 How It Should Work:
✅ Users select their health conditions & dietary preferences.
✅ The system matches symptoms to diet recommendations from a pre-built database.
✅ Uses probability-based logic & predefined rules to suggest the best meal plans.
✅ Provides interactive visuals (charts/tables) using ShadCN components.
✅ Ensures smooth routing & database integration for saving user preferences.

🔹 Key Implementation Details:
1️⃣ Update the Database with Diet Recommendations
Add a diet_plans.json file in the database.

Store pre-mapped health conditions → diet recommendations.

Include sample meal plans for diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart health, etc.

2️⃣ Build the UI with ShadCN for a Sleek Look
Create a Smart Diet Plan Page (/diet-plans).

Add a checkbox-based health condition selection.

Use a ShadCN card layout to display meal recommendations.

Ensure the diet results are visually appealing using Tailwind styles.

3️⃣ Implement the Logic for Personalized Diet Plans
Use predefined matching logic instead of an external API.

Assign weights & probabilities to different meal plans based on user input.

Ensure users get different plans based on selected health issues.

4️⃣ Allow Users to Save & Modify Their Plans
Store selected diet plans in the database for easy retrieval.

Allow users to customize their diet plan (swap meals, change portions).

5️⃣ Ensure Smooth Navigation & Perfect Routing
✅ Clicking on Smart Diet Plans in the homepage must open the correct page.
✅ Users should be able to go back & modify inputs without losing progress.
✅ Ensure no 404 errors & proper redirection to /diet-plans.

🔥 Final Instructions:

Ensure the Smart Diet Plans feature is fully functional & AI-like.

Use only database-driven logic, NO API KEYS.

Keep the UI clean, interactive, and visually appealing with ShadCN components.

Make sure routing is flawless & no features are broken!
