🔹 File-wise Implementation Details:
1️⃣ Database – Store Health Schemes Data
📌 File: database/health_schemes.json

Create a JSON file to store details of at least 10+ health schemes.

Each scheme must include:

id: Unique identifier

name: Scheme title

description: Short summary

eligibility: Who can apply

benefits: Key advantages

application_process: How to apply

official_link: Government/WHO source

image_url: A relevant image

Ensure data is structured properly for easy retrieval.

2️⃣ Backend – API Route to Fetch Health Schemes
📌 File: server/routes/healthSchemes.js

Create an API route to fetch schemes from the database.

Implement search functionality by name & eligibility.

Ensure the response is optimized for performance (limit to top 10 results).

3️⃣ Frontend – UI to Display Health Schemes
📌 File: components/HealthSchemesCard.js

Create a ShadCN-based card for each scheme.

Display title, image, and short description.

Add a "Read More" button to expand full details.

Include smooth animations & colorful visuals for engagement.

📌 File: pages/HealthSchemes.js

Fetch data from health_schemes.json via the API.

Show a grid layout of all schemes using HealthSchemesCard.js.

Implement search & filter options (e.g., schemes for seniors, women, etc.).

Add pagination or infinite scroll to improve user experience.

Ensure seamless dark/light mode toggle with ShadCN.

4️⃣ Homepage – Show Featured Schemes
📌 File: pages/Home.js

Display random 3-4 health schemes from health_schemes.json.

Ensure clicking “View All” redirects correctly to /health-schemes.

5️⃣ Routing – Ensure Perfect Navigation
📌 File: router/index.js

Add the route for /health-schemes.

Ensure no 404 errors, broken links, or incorrect paths.

6️⃣ Enhancements for Better UX
✅ Bookmark Feature: Allow users to save schemes for later reference.
✅ Comparison Mode: Enable side-by-side comparisons of schemes.
