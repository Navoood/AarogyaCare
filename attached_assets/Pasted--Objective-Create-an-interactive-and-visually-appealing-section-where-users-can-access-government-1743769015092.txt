🔹 Objective:
Create an interactive and visually appealing section where users can access government health schemes.
💡 MUST LOOK & FUNCTION LIKE AI, BUT WITHOUT USING API KEYS!

🛠 How It Should Work:
✅ Display detailed information on government health schemes (source: WHO & official sources).
✅ Include high-quality images for each scheme.
✅ Use ShadCN components for a sleek, colorful, and interactive UI.
✅ Ensure perfect routing – no broken pages or missing content.
✅ Store scheme details in a database (JSON format) instead of using an API.

🔹 Key Implementation Details:
1️⃣ Create a Structured Database for Health Schemes
Store health_schemes.json in the database.

Include details like scheme name, eligibility, benefits, application process, and official links.

Preload at least 10+ schemes covering different demographics (low-income families, seniors, rural areas, etc.).

Add an image URL for each scheme (fetch from WHO or government portals).

2️⃣ Build an Interactive UI with ShadCN Components
Create a Government Health Schemes Page (/health-schemes).

Use ShadCN cards for each scheme, displaying title, image, and a short description.

Clicking a card should expand to show full details with a Read More option.

Add search & filter options (e.g., schemes for women, elderly, children).

Ensure smooth animations & colorful visuals for engagement.

3️⃣ Implement Dynamic Content Loading (Without API Keys)
Fetch data from the JSON database instead of an external API.

Display random featured schemes on the homepage for dynamic engagement.

Use pagination or infinite scroll to load more schemes interactively.

4️⃣ Enhance User Experience with Interactive Features
✅ Bookmark feature – Allow users to save schemes for later reference.
✅ Comparison mode – Enable users to compare different schemes side by side.
✅ Multilingual support – Display scheme information in multiple languages based on user selection.
✅ Dark/Light Mode Toggle – Ensure seamless theme switching with ShadCN.

5️⃣ Ensure Smooth Navigation & Perfect Routing
✅ Clicking on Government Health Schemes in the homepage must open the correct page.
✅ Users should be able to return to the homepage without losing progress.
✅ Ensure no 404 errors & proper redirection to /health-schemes.
